## What we solve
Avoid “growing by shock”: dimension infrastructure, anticipate peaks, and have a clear scaling path.

## Deliverables

### 1. Load Diagnosis
* Target concurrent users.
* Usage profile (exams, assignments, video conferencing, SCORM).
* Main bottleneck review (DB, IO, PHP, network).

### 2. Architecture Design
* Web scaling (horizontal).
* Caching and session strategy.
* DB: replication, tuning, and load separation.

### 3. Tests and Thresholds
* Representative load tests.
* Recommended limits and alerts.
* Recommendations by stage (today, 3 months, 12 months).

## Result
* Growth with controlled costs.
* Fewer risks in enrolment/exams.
* Supported technical decisions.
