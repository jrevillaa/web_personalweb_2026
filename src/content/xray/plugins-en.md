## Typical risk
A plugin can add value… or break upgrades, degrade performance, and open vulnerabilities.

## Governance Approach

### 1. Inventory and Classification
* Contributed vs custom.
* Criticality: academic, operational, nice-to-have.
* Lifecycle: support, roadmap, alternative.

### 2. Compatibility and Quality
* Validation by Moodle version.
* Performance impact review.
* UAT testing with representative courses.

### 3. Controlled Maintenance
* Versioning and change control.
* Update and rollback windows.
* Configuration documentation.

## Result
* Fewer surprises in upgrades.
* Better stability.
* Plugins aligned with institutional strategy.
