## The Challenge
Deploy a new major version of Moodle and migrate academic content ensuring teachers and students can start activities without interruptions.

## The Solution
We performed a complete **Moodle 4.0** implementation:
* Base installation and configuration of the platform.
* Initial configuration of academic structure (categories, roles, policies).
* Course migration to the new platform.
* Functional validation (access, enrolment, resources, assessments).

## Results
* **Moodle 4.0** platform operational and ready for the academic cycle.
* Courses migrated and accessible to teachers/students.
* Modern base to scale integrations and UX improvements.
