## The Challenge
The Zoom plugin available in the version used had functional limitations for academic operation at scale (recurring classes, access to recordings, and mass management).

## The Solution
We expanded the plugin capabilities:
* Retrieval/listing and **recording download** option.
* Flows for **mass meeting creation** (reducing manual work).
* UI/operational adjustments for teachers and academic coordination.
* Validation by profiles (teacher/admin) and tests in pilot courses.

## Results
* Teachers manage Zoom with less friction and more autonomy.
* Fewer manual repetitive tasks in session creation.
* Better traceability of sessions and recordings within the course.
