## The Challenge
Have a cloud Moodle platform implemented from scratch, ensuring correct configuration and ready to grow according to demand.

## The Solution
Implementation on **AWS**:
* Server provisioning and dependencies.
* Installation and configuration of Moodle (web stack + database).
* Initial security/best practices configuration (cron, basic backups, caches).
* Functional validation of access and base operation.

## Results
* Moodle deployed on **AWS** and ready for launch.
* Scalable base to grow in courses/users.
* Initial configuration aligned with stable operation.
