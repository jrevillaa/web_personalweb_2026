## The Challenge
Set up a robust platform for **evaluations**, with high availability requirements, concurrency peaks, and continuity in case of failures.

## The Solution
We implemented **Moodle 4.1** with an architecture approach for HA:
* Deployment design oriented to scalability (separation of critical components).
* Hardening and best practices (backups, SSL, basic monitoring, initial optimization).
* Performance tuning for exams: caching, initial tuning, and session policies.
* Basic load tests and stability validation in concurrency scenarios.

## Results
* Platform ready for **exam scenarios** with better peak tolerance.
* More resilient operation prepared to grow.
* Reduction of incidents associated with availability in critical periods.
