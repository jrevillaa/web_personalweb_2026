## The Challenge
Modernize the e-learning platform with a major update, ensuring plugin compatibility and operational continuity during migration from a previous platform.

## The Solution
We implemented **Moodle 4.4** end-to-end:
* Base installation and configuration (DEV/UAT/PROD environments).
* Customization of workflows (roles, enrolment, categories, reports).
* Migration of courses and academic structure from the old platform.
* Compatibility review and adjustments of plugins (contributed and custom).
* Pre-production QA checklist (performance, roles/permissions, backups).

## Results
* Platform updated to **Moodle 4.4** with stable operation.
* Course migration executed with minimal friction for end users.
* Improved maintainability and base ready for future integrations.
