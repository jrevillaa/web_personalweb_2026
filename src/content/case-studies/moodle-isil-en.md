## The Challenge
Implement a Moodle capable of supporting high demand and service continuity through a **High Availability** architecture in cloud.

## The Solution
We implemented Moodle 3.11 under a resilience approach:
* Deployment and configuration of **Moodle 3.11**.
* Design/implementation under **high availability** architecture on **Huawei Cloud**.
* Base configurations oriented to stability (cron, caches, best practices).
* Operation and continuity validations.

## Results
* Platform available and more tolerant to usage peaks.
* Better operational continuity for critical periods (evaluations/closures).
* Cloud base ready to scale and evolve integrations.
