## The Challenge
Execute a major Moodle upgrade, avoiding breaks due to version changes, plugin dependencies, and theme/template adjustments.

## The Solution
We performed the controlled upgrade from **Moodle 3.9 to 4.1**:
* Inventory of plugins and compatibility evaluation.
* Update of contributed plugins and adjustment of custom plugins.
* Functional validation: access, roles, enrolment, courses, reports, and evaluations.
* Backup strategy and rollback plan to ensure secure deployment window.

## Results
* Moodle updated to **4.1** with operational and validated plugins.
* Greater stability and modern base for UX/functional improvements.
* Reduced risk for future maintenance.
