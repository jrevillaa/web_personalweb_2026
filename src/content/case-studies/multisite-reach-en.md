## The Challenge
Have a single Moodle platform that can serve different brands or units, showing different visual identity according to the access domain or subdomain.

## The Solution
We prepared Moodle for multi-site behavior:
* Site identification by **domain/subdomain**.
* Application of **dynamic branding** (logo/colors/texts) by domain.
* Structure and rules to maintain consistency and facilitate operation.
* Navigation and session tests to avoid identity crossovers.

## Results
* A Moodle with “visual multi-site” capability per domain.
* Lower operational cost (one platform, multiple brands).
* Better experience for users feeling the environment “their own” brand.
