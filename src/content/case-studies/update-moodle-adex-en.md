## The Challenge
Update Moodle from 3.8 to 3.11 without losing plugin compatibility, maintaining data integrity, and reducing downtime risks.

## The Solution
We performed a secure and verifiable upgrade:
* Generation of full **backups** prior to intervention.
* Moodle update from **3.8 to 3.11**.
* Update of contributed plugins.
* Adaptation of old plugins to ensure compatibility with the new version.
* Post-upgrade validations (navigation, roles, courses, cron, and caches).

## Results
* Platform updated to **Moodle 3.11**.
* Key plugins operational (including necessary adaptations).
* Improvements in maintainability and security by being on a more recent version.
