## The Challenge
Avoid double entry and automate the relationship between the academic ERP (PeopleSoft) and the LMS (Moodle) to manage students, courses, and enrolments.

## The Solution
We built automation for key processes:
* Student synchronization: **create / update / delete**.
* Course synchronization: **create / update / delete**.
* Automation of **enrolment** in Moodle from PeopleSoft.
* Error handling and validations for data consistency.

## Results
* Integrated academic processes with less manual intervention.
* Greater information consistency between PeopleSoft and Moodle.
* Reduction of operational times during enrolment periods.
