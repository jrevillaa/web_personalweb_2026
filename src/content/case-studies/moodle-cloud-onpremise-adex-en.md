## The Challenge
Move the Moodle platform from the cloud to a server managed by the client (on-premise), ensuring continuity, security (domain/SSL), and post-migration stability.

## The Solution
We executed a controlled migration:
* Preparation of **CentOS 7** Linux environment for Moodle.
* Migration of Moodle from **Cloud** server to **On-Premise**.
* Configuration of **domains and SSL**.
* Application of configuration and optimization best practices (cron, caches, site health).

## Results
* Moodle running on **on-premise** infrastructure under client control.
* Platform accessible under secure domain with **SSL**.
* Operation more stable and ready for the next upgrade step.
