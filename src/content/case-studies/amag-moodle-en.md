## The Challenge
Set up an institutional Moodle and connect it with the SGA to reduce manual work and ensure consistency between users/courses/enrolments.

## The Solution
Implementation and integration:
* Moodle deployment and initial configuration.
* Integration with the **SGA** for academic data synchronization.
* Automation rules for creation/updates and enrolments.
* Consistency tests and operational validation.

## Results
* E-learning platform operational and integrated with the SGA.
* Fewer manual academic administration tasks.
* More consistent data between systems.
