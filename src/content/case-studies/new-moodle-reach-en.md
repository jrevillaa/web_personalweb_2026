## The Challenge
Allow certain courses to have a public page (landing type) to inform and facilitate the enrolment of new or former students, without exposing the rest of the virtual classroom.

## The Solution
We developed an adaptation in Moodle:
* Option per course to enable a **public landing**.
* Presentation of key course information (description, dates, call to action).
* User-oriented enrolment flow (login/registration and enrolment).
* Security considerations to not expose private content.

## Results
* Courses with enable-able public landing “on demand”.
* Better acquisition and re-enrolment experience from a simple entry point.
* Less friction to convert interested parties into active students.
