## The Challenge
To bring digital education to students in rural areas of the Andes and Peruvian Amazon where internet connection is unstable or non-existent.

## The Solution
We developed a custom version of **Moodle Mobile App** and a local server on tablets/laptops (based on optimized MoodleBox) allowing:
* Full course navigation without internet.
* Offline quizzes and assignments.
* Smart bidirectional synchronization when the device detects a connection.

## The Outcome
* **+500,000 students** reached.
* 90% reduction in mobile data dependency.
* Recognized as a success story in government e-learning.
