## The Challenge
Bring digital education to students in rural areas of the Andes and Peruvian Amazon where there is no stable internet connection or it is non-existent.

## The Solution
We developed a customized version of **Moodle Mobile App** and a local server on tablets/laptops (based on optimized MoodleBox) that allows:
* Full course navigation without internet.
* Offline quizzes and assignments.
* Intelligent bidirectional synchronization when the device detects connection.

## Results
* **+500,000 students** benefited.
* 90% reduction in mobile data dependency.
* Recognized as a success case in government e-learning.
