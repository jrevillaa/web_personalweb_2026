## The Challenge
To have an institutional mobile app with its own identity, ready for distribution, maintaining compatibility with the Moodle backend and a consistent experience for the student.

## The Solution
We implemented a **Moodle App** on base 4.3 with a “ready-to-publish” approach:
* Full branding (logos, colors, texts, splash, app icons).
* Configuration of endpoints and session/notification policies.
* UX adjustments for navigation and access to key content.
* Preparation of builds and checklist for publication (metadata, versioning, signatures).

## Results
* Institutional app ready for **Play Store** and **App Store**.
* Mobile experience consistent with the Moodle ecosystem.
* Reduced access friction for students (fewer steps, more adoption).
