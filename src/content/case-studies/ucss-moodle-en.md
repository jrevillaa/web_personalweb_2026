## The Challenge
Implement a cloud platform and ensure knowledge transfer so the internal team can operate it (support, administration, and academic management).

## The Solution
We executed implementation + operational enablement:
* Implementation of **Moodle 3.10** on **Huawei Cloud**.
* Base configuration for operation (roles, structure, recurring tasks).
* Training for **IT** staff (administration, maintenance, best practices).
* Training for academic team (course management and functional operation).

## Results
* Virtual classroom operational in cloud with **Moodle 3.10**.
* Internal teams trained to administer and provide support.
* Less dependence on third parties for day-to-day operation.
